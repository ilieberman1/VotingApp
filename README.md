Daily Pulse

📖 Overview

Daily Pulse is a unique social platform that encourages meaningful engagement through daily, curated prompts. Each day, users anonymously cast their votes on one question developed by our team (like Wordle gives one 5 letter word to guess each day). After voting, users get to see detailed information on voting percentages based on various demographics (i.e. 75% of males under 18 choose this answer). These demographics include things like age, gender, seucality, political preference, etc. Users can then dive deeper into structured, moderated discussions, sharing and exploring diverse perspectives. They can either post a comment explaining their answer or respond to others comments.
